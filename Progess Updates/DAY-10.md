# Progress Update
Today, I solved two Leetcode problems, including a hard one, on a topic that I'm not strong in yet: dynamic programming. It was a challenge, but I'm glad that I took it on. I learned a lot about dynamic programming, and I feel more confident in my ability to solve problems that use this technique.
I'm not sure if I'll be able to solve every hard Leetcode problem yet, but I'm determined to keep trying. I know that the more practice I get, the better I'll become.
