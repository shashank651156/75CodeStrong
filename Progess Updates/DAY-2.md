# Progess of day 2
Today, I tried to complete three questions on LeetCode which you can check out in the Code Challenges folder. Also, I studied about the Queue and circular Queue Data Structure in java.
Tried one hard question but failed in two test cases out of 136 due to exceeding time limit. Will try after learning other concepts.
Drank 4+ litres of water and before sleeping I'll try to read a book names "As a man thinketh".
